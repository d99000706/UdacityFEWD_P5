readme.txt for Neighborhood App

The Neighborhood App shows a google map of restaurants in the Alpharetta, GA area.
The map markers can be clicked to view the restaurant's name and select that restaurant.
Toggle the form view by clicking on the hamburger icon.
In the form view you can:
 - see the list of restaurants
 - click on a restaurant to select/de-select it
 - filter the restaurant list with keywords
 - see a list of related links on the selected restaurant from google search
    (note that the google search api limits the number of free searches to about 100 per day [I think?] 
     so that if you run/restart this app more 100/7 restaurants =~ 14 times in a day, then the related links will stop showing up)
 - click on a related link to open that url in another browser window
 - the reset button will remove any filtering and de-select any selected restaurant
